# Headers and Example files


> This folder will include my custom header files.
> The purpose is to built out and proved a higher level of abstraction for the user. 

> I will include some example files to go along with the headers as I get a chance.

## Contents

> Devices.h - A file for working with multiple devices.

> my_utilities.hpp - Personal helper classes and functions


## Notes:

> The devices.h file and the Utilities files are independent currently. They can be included together to provide more functionality
  but as it stands one does not depend on the other.
