# Headers and Example files


> This folder will include my custom header files.

> The purpose is to build out and provide a higher level of abstraction for the user. 

> I will include some example files to go along with the headers as I get a chance.

## Contents

> Devices.h - A file for working with multiple devices.

> Utilities.hpp - Personal helper classes and functions


## Notes:

> The devices.h file and the Utilities files are currently independent of each other.  They can be included together to provide more functionality
  but as it stands one does not depend on the other.
